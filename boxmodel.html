        <p> I am greatly moved by topics concerning SDGs and use of tecchnology in the achievement of these goals</p>
        <p> Academically, I find Statistics very interesting, especially on the financial aspect ie finacial analysis and economics</p>
        <p> I am currently obsessed with coding, I hope to land a role in Tech soon, (prob in May 2023) and build exciting websites and finally, my Portfolio !</p>
        <p> I am most likely to shift my interests but, primarily, these three have a special place in my heart!</p>
